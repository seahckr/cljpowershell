# cljpowershell

A simple library to work with Powershell in idiomatic clojure

Builds on the [jPowershell](https://github.com/profesorfalken/jPowerShell) library

## Usage

To execute a series of command on a remote node

```
(cljpowershell.core/on "dev-deepne" "hostname" "hostname" "hostname")
=> ("dev-deepne\r\n" "dev-deepne\r\n" "dev-deepne\r\n")


```

Assumes that Powershell remoting between localhost and remote node is working.

Intended to be a drop-in replacement for
